const myLibrary = [];

function Book() {
  // the constructor...
}

function addBookToLibrary() {
  // do stuff here
}



//Use <dialog> dynamically to make our book entries that will be added to #Body of the page
//Diaglog box should be formatted to look like the boxes of info we will see when we input it in the body
// make the dynamics work first? or should I style it with css first, i thoink dyunamics first will be more impactful and cause I dont know my JS as good as my css, i think it would be good practice.
